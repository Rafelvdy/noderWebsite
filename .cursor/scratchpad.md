# Noder Landing Page - Testimonials Section Responsive Design + Previous Issues

## Background and Motivation

**NEW URGENT TASK: Testimonials Section Responsive Design** üì±üíª

The testimonials section needs comprehensive responsive design improvements to work seamlessly across all screen sizes while maintaining the current iPhone SE design as the foundation.

**Current Testimonials Structure Analysis**:
- TestimonialContainer: 50% height, centered with overflow hidden
- TestimonialBox: 80% width, aspect-ratio 16/9, absolutely positioned
- GSAP Animation: moves from `bottom: -100%` ‚Üí `bottom: 25%` ‚Üí `bottom: 100%`
- Text carousel and logos carousel are separate 100% width sections
- Design optimized for iPhone SE (375px width)

**Current Issues**:
1. **Inconsistent Centering**: Testimonials don't reliably center on different screen sizes
2. **Text Scale Problems**: Text carousel becomes "stupidly massive" on larger screens  
3. **Logo Sizing Issues**: Logos don't maintain proper relationship to text size
4. **Desktop Layout Needs**: At 1024px+ need testimonials on right half (50% width)
5. **Text Spacing Control**: Distance between testimonial text and author needs better control
6. **Animation Positioning**: GSAP animations need to adapt to different container sizes

**Desired Responsive Behavior**:
- **Mobile (‚â§1023px)**: Current iPhone SE design as base, scale appropriately
- **Desktop (‚â•1024px)**: Testimonials 50% width positioned on right half
- **Text Carousel**: Responsive but capped to prevent excessive size
- **Logos**: Always smaller than text, proportionally scaled
- **Testimonials**: Always center in their container regardless of screen size

# Noder Landing Page - Server Model Animation Fix + Dynamic Text Color + Memory Optimization

## Background and Motivation

**NEW CRITICAL ISSUE: 3D Model Memory Optimization** üö®

Current implementation has significant memory inefficiencies that impact performance, especially on mobile devices and when multiple models are loaded:

**Current Memory Issues**:
- Each ServerModel3D creates a complete Three.js rendering pipeline (renderer, composer, scene, lights)
- Same GLB model file loaded multiple times into memory
- Models stay in memory throughout entire page lifecycle regardless of visibility
- No resource sharing between model instances
- Continuous rendering even when models are off-screen

**Impact**: 
- High memory usage (each model instance ~20-50MB depending on device)
- Potential memory leaks on page navigation
- Poor performance on mobile devices
- Unnecessary GPU/CPU usage when models aren't visible

**Memory Optimization Goals**:
- Reduce memory footprint by 60-80%
- Share resources between model instances  
- Implement conditional rendering based on scroll position
- Maintain all existing animation functionality

---

**URGENT: New Critical Animation Issue Identified**

The second server model (server2ModelRef) has a scroll animation bug where it correctly animates from right to center when scrolling down to section 2, but when scrolling back up past section 2, it remains stuck in the center instead of animating back off-screen.

**Current Behavior**: 
- ‚úÖ Server animates from right side to center when entering section 2 (scrolling down)
- ‚ùå Server stays in center when scrolling back up past section 2 (should exit off-screen)
- ‚ùå No reverse animation logic for upward scrolling

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. `animateServer2Entrance` function only handles forward scroll direction
2. ScrollTrigger animations are one-directional - no exit animations
3. Server position gets "stuck" in center position after initial entrance
4. Missing scroll trigger for reverse animation when leaving section 2 upward

**Desired State**: 
- Server should smoothly animate back off-screen (to right side) when scrolling up past section 2
- All existing animations should remain intact and functional
- Server background should remain transparent as requested
- No negative impact on other scroll animations or 3D model behaviors

---

**Previous Project Context** (Dynamic Text Color Feature):
The user wants to implement an advanced visual effect where text elements dynamically change to white color only in the areas where the actual 3D server model shape is positioned behind them. This should work with the precise geometry of the 3D model, not just its container boundaries.

**Current State**: 
- Text elements have static colors (black for titles, gray for subtitles)
- 3D server models move and scale during scroll animations
- Text and models are layered using CSS z-index

**Desired State**: 
- Text turns white dynamically where the 3D model geometry is behind it
- Only the specific parts of text overlapping with the model should change color
- Effect should work smoothly during scroll animations and model transformations

**Technology Requirements**: 
- Three.js for 3D geometry analysis and projection
- Canvas-based text rendering or WebGL shaders for pixel-level control
- Real-time collision detection between 3D model and 2D text bounds
- Performance optimization for smooth 60fps animation

### Current Implementation Analysis

**3D Model Structure** (from ServerModel.tsx):
```tsx
// Models load GLB file and expose serverObject reference
const ServerModel3D = forwardRef<ServerModel3DRef, ServerModel3DProps>(...)
// Provides getServerObject() method returning THREE.Group
```

**Text Elements** (from page.tsx):
```tsx
// Hero title with ref for animations
<div className={styles.HeroTitle} ref={heroTitleRef}>
  <h1>THE MOST EFFICIENT NODES ON <span className={styles.SolanaGradient}>SOLANA</span></h1>
</div>
// Hero subtitle with ref
<div className={styles.HeroSubtitle} ref={heroSubtitleRef}>
  <h2>[The first fully owned, performance-optimized RPC infrastructure built for Web3]</h2>
</div>
```

**Current Animation System** (from page.tsx):
```javascript
// Models rotate and move during scroll
serverObject.rotation.y = progress * Math.PI * 2;
// Text moves horizontally during scroll
x: `-${progress * 150}%`
```

**Server2 Animation Issue** (from animateServer2Entrance function):
```javascript
// Current entrance animation - only handles forward direction
gsap.to(server2ModelContainerRef.current, {
    scrollTrigger: {
        trigger: section2Ref.current,
        start: "30% bottom",
        end: "30% center",
        scrub: false,
    },
    right: "50%",
    transform: "translateX(50%) translateY(-50%)",
    // No reverse animation when scrolling back up
});
```

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**URGENT ANIMATION FIX CHALLENGES:**
1. **Bidirectional Scroll Handling**: Current ScrollTrigger setup only handles downward scrolling
2. **Animation State Management**: Need to track and manage server position state properly
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Ensure seamless animation in both directions
4. **Performance**: Avoid conflicting animations or janky transitions
5. **Scroll Direction Detection**: Implement proper scroll direction awareness

**DYNAMIC TEXT COLOR CHALLENGES** (Previous Project):
1. **3D-to-2D Projection Complexity**: Converting 3D model geometry to screen coordinates for collision detection
2. **Real-time Performance**: Collision detection must run at 60fps during scroll animations  
3. **Pixel-Level Accuracy**: Need precise detection of model shape, not just bounding boxes
4. **Text Rendering Method**: Choose between Canvas masking, CSS clip-path, or WebGL shaders
5. **Dynamic Text Splitting**: Text may need to be split into smaller segments for granular color control
6. **Browser Compatibility**: Solution must work across modern browsers
7. **Memory Management**: Avoid memory leaks from frequent collision calculations

- This will allow Server 2 to have wider field of view without affecting Server 1
- Expected solution: Wider FOV (18-20¬∞) for Server 2 vs current 12¬∞ FOV

## Lessons

*This section will be updated as development progresses*

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it  
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command 
- **NEW**: ScrollTrigger animations need proper bidirectional handling - always consider both scroll directions
- **NEW**: Test scroll animations in both directions during development to catch stuck states early 
- **NEW**: Memory optimization in Three.js - Model sharing via cloning is extremely effective for reducing memory usage
- **NEW**: Intersection Observer is essential for conditional rendering - provides significant performance gains when models are off-screen
- **NEW**: Singleton pattern for resource management (ModelManager) prevents duplicate loading and enables centralized optimization
- **NEW**: TypeScript ref types need to be updated when adding new methods to component interfaces
- **NEW**: Memory monitoring should be built-in for any performance optimization - provides concrete evidence of improvements
