# Noder Landing Page - Server Model Animation Fix + Dynamic Text Color

## Background and Motivation

**URGENT: New Critical Animation Issue Identified**

The second server model (server2ModelRef) has a scroll animation bug where it correctly animates from right to center when scrolling down to section 2, but when scrolling back up past section 2, it remains stuck in the center instead of animating back off-screen.

**Current Behavior**: 
- ‚úÖ Server animates from right side to center when entering section 2 (scrolling down)
- ‚ùå Server stays in center when scrolling back up past section 2 (should exit off-screen)
- ‚ùå No reverse animation logic for upward scrolling

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. `animateServer2Entrance` function only handles forward scroll direction
2. ScrollTrigger animations are one-directional - no exit animations
3. Server position gets "stuck" in center position after initial entrance
4. Missing scroll trigger for reverse animation when leaving section 2 upward

**Desired State**: 
- Server should smoothly animate back off-screen (to right side) when scrolling up past section 2
- All existing animations should remain intact and functional
- Server background should remain transparent as requested
- No negative impact on other scroll animations or 3D model behaviors

**Previous Project Context** (Dynamic Text Color Feature):
The user wants to implement an advanced visual effect where text elements dynamically change to white color only in the areas where the actual 3D server model shape is positioned behind them. This should work with the precise geometry of the 3D model, not just its container boundaries.

**Current State**: 
- Text elements have static colors (black for titles, gray for subtitles)
- 3D server models move and scale during scroll animations
- Text and models are layered using CSS z-index

**Desired State**: 
- Text turns white dynamically where the 3D model geometry is behind it
- Only the specific parts of text overlapping with the model should change color
- Effect should work smoothly during scroll animations and model transformations

**Technology Requirements**: 
- Three.js for 3D geometry analysis and projection
- Canvas-based text rendering or WebGL shaders for pixel-level control
- Real-time collision detection between 3D model and 2D text bounds
- Performance optimization for smooth 60fps animation

### Current Implementation Analysis

**3D Model Structure** (from ServerModel.tsx):
```tsx
// Models load GLB file and expose serverObject reference
const ServerModel3D = forwardRef<ServerModel3DRef, ServerModel3DProps>(...)
// Provides getServerObject() method returning THREE.Group
```

**Text Elements** (from page.tsx):
```tsx
// Hero title with ref for animations
<div className={styles.HeroTitle} ref={heroTitleRef}>
  <h1>THE MOST EFFICIENT NODES ON <span className={styles.SolanaGradient}>SOLANA</span></h1>
</div>
// Hero subtitle with ref
<div className={styles.HeroSubtitle} ref={heroSubtitleRef}>
  <h2>[The first fully owned, performance-optimized RPC infrastructure built for Web3]</h2>
</div>
```

**Current Animation System** (from page.tsx):
```javascript
// Models rotate and move during scroll
serverObject.rotation.y = progress * Math.PI * 2;
// Text moves horizontally during scroll
x: `-${progress * 150}%`
```

**Server2 Animation Issue** (from animateServer2Entrance function):
```javascript
// Current entrance animation - only handles forward direction
gsap.to(server2ModelContainerRef.current, {
    scrollTrigger: {
        trigger: section2Ref.current,
        start: "30% bottom",
        end: "30% center",
        scrub: false,
    },
    right: "50%",
    transform: "translateX(50%) translateY(-50%)",
    // No reverse animation when scrolling back up
});
```

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**URGENT ANIMATION FIX CHALLENGES:**
1. **Bidirectional Scroll Handling**: Current ScrollTrigger setup only handles downward scrolling
2. **Animation State Management**: Need to track and manage server position state properly
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Ensure seamless animation in both directions
4. **Performance**: Avoid conflicting animations or janky transitions
5. **Scroll Direction Detection**: Implement proper scroll direction awareness

**DYNAMIC TEXT COLOR CHALLENGES** (Previous Project):
1. **3D-to-2D Projection Complexity**: Converting 3D model geometry to screen coordinates for collision detection
2. **Real-time Performance**: Collision detection must run at 60fps during scroll animations  
3. **Pixel-Level Accuracy**: Need precise detection of model shape, not just bounding boxes
4. **Text Rendering Method**: Choose between Canvas masking, CSS clip-path, or WebGL shaders
5. **Dynamic Text Splitting**: Text may need to be split into smaller segments for granular color control
6. **Browser Compatibility**: Solution must work across modern browsers
7. **Memory Management**: Avoid memory leaks from frequent collision calculations

## Project Status Board

### **üö® URGENT - HIGH PRIORITY**
- [x] **Task 1**: Fix Server2 Model Scroll Animation Bug - **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ
- [x] **Task 2**: Fix Mobile Viewport Height Scaling Issue - **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

**Task 2 Solution Details:**
- **Problem**: First server model scaling was recalculating when mobile browser UI showed/hid, changing `100dvh` values
- **Root Cause**: ScrollTrigger using `end: "bottom top"` which recalculated when section height changed with `dvh`
- **Solution**: Store initial viewport height in `initialViewportHeightRef` and use `end: () => \`+=\${initialViewportHeightRef.current}\`` for fixed pixel-based end point
- **Result**: Sections still grow/shrink with `dvh` as intended, but server model scaling remains consistent regardless of mobile UI changes
- **Files Modified**: `src/app/new-try/page.tsx` (lines 39, 244, 260)
